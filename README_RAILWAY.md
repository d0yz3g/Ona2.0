# Deploying ONA Bot on Railway

This guide explains how to deploy the ONA Telegram bot on Railway.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account with the ONA bot code repository
2. A Railway account (https://railway.app/)
3. Your Telegram bot token (from BotFather)
4. Any other API keys required by the bot (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push your code to GitHub

Make sure your code is in a GitHub repository.

### 2. Connect to Railway

1. Go to Railway.app and log in
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Wait for Railway to build the initial deployment

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables in Railway dashboard:

- `BOT_TOKEN` - Your Telegram bot token from BotFather
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI features)
- `ELEVEN_TOKEN` - Your ElevenLabs API token (if using voice features)
- Any other required API keys or configuration values

### 4. Configure the Deployment

Make sure the deployment settings are:

- Build Command: `pip install pydantic==1.10.12 aiogram==3.0.0`
- Start Command: `python main.py`

### 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the deployment:

1. **Supabase Connection Issues**
   - The bot will automatically fall back to SQLite if Supabase is not available
   - No additional configuration is needed for the fallback

2. **Pydantic Compatibility Issues**
   - The bot includes automatic patching for pydantic compatibility with aiogram
   - This is handled in patch_pydantic.py

3. **Deployment Fails**
   - Check Railway logs for specific error messages
   - Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify that Railway is using the correct Python version (3.11)

## Railway Configuration Files

The repository includes two important files for Railway deployment:

1. `railway.toml` - Configures the Railway project
2. `Dockerfile` - Specifies how to build the Docker container

## Automatic Restart

The bot is configured to automatically restart on failure with:

```toml
[deploy]
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

## Bot Status Monitoring

You can monitor the bot status through Railway's logs and metrics dashboard.
